# 2 Branch It
## A simple repo to practice branching.

Branch my Master. 
You will be adding a file that calculates a mathematical formula. Feel free to do this in a simple environment like JDoodle.

Add your file, including a Commit with appropriate message.

Submit a Pull Request: Click the Green "Compare and pull request" button.  You can include a friendly message to me and then click "Create Pull Request".

Use the same naming convention I used for the file name.
Use your favorite (or not) math formula.
Make sure to follow proper Rioux Style.
